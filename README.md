# Cyberdudebivash Anti-virus

## Overview
Cyberdudebivash Anti-virus is a Python-based antivirus application inspired by leading solutions like Quick Heal and Norton. It includes core features for malware detection, real-time protection, quarantine management, and virus definition updates. Built with Tkinter for the GUI, it provides a user-friendly dashboard. Note: This is a basic implementation for educational purposes—real antivirus requires advanced low-level access and constant updates.

## Features (Aligned with 2025 Standards)
- **Real-Time Threat Protection**: Monitors file creations/modifications using Watchdog library (AI-like behavior simulation via hashing).
- **Malware Scanning**: Scans files/directories for known signatures (viruses, ransomware, etc.) using MD5 hashing.
- **Anti-Ransomware & Malware Protection**: Detects and quarantines threats.
- **Quarantine Management**: Isolates infected files; allows restore/delete.
- **Virus Definition Updates**: Fetches latest signatures from a URL (placeholder—implement real API).
- **Firewall & Web Protection**: Placeholder labels (extend with OS APIs for real integration).
- **Dark Web Monitoring, Safe Banking, Parental Controls**: Simulated placeholders for premium features.
- **USB/External Drive Protection**: Scan external dirs manually.
- **Cloud Backup & AI Detection**: Not fully implemented; extend with cloud APIs/ML libs like scikit-learn.

Similar to Quick Heal's GoDeep.AI and Norton's AI-powered detection, but simplified.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+.
- Libraries: `tkinter` (built-in), `watchdog` (for real-time—`pip install watchdog`), `requests` (for updates—`pip install requests`).
